## Where to find things

### Assignment 1: Local search

Check out `local-search` module and its `Main` class implementing Taboo search for MTSP.
The results are plotted by `plotting` module. The results in plaintext are in `results/local-search` folder.
The format is `initial_<number_of_cities>_<number_of_travellers>.txt` for initial solution and
`final_<number_of_cities>_<number_of_travellers>.txt` for the best solution.
You can check out the `png` pictures.

### Assignment 2: Basic evolution algorithm


Check out `basic-evolution` module and its `Main` class implementing basic evolution algorithm for MTSP.
The results are plotted by `plotting` module. The results in plaintext are in `results/basic-evolution` folder.
The format is `initial_<number_of_cities>_<number_of_travellers>.txt` for initial solution and
`final_<number_of_cities>_<number_of_travellers>.txt` for the best solution.
You can check out the `png` pictures.

### Assignment 2: Memetic algorithm

Check out `basic-evolution` module and its `Main` class implementing evolution algorithm with memetics for MTSP.
The results are plotted by `plotting` module. The results in plaintext are in `results/memetics` folder.
The format is `initial_<number_of_cities>_<number_of_travellers>.txt` for initial solution and
`final_<number_of_cities>_<number_of_travellers>.txt` for the best solution.
You can check out the `png` pictures.
